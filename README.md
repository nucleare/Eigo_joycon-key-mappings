## How To Use These Mappings

### Pairing Your JoyCons

1. Open up your [Bluetooth Settings](http://www.windowscentral.com/how-and-why-use-bluetooth-on-windows-10)
2. Make sure Bluetooth is set to on
3. Hold the sync button on the JoyCon you wish to pair until the lights flash
    * The sync button is the one in between the SL and SR buttons on each JoyCon
4. Click pair when the JoyCon pops up in the Bluetooth list

You are now paired.

### Setting Up JoyToKey

1. Download [JoyToKey](http://joytokey.net/)
2. Unzip the file
3. Copy each configuration into the JoyToKey directory that you just created
4. Open JoyToKey

The configurations should appear in the left panel.

### Using Configurations

Once you have paired your JoyCons, and setup JoyToKey, do the following

1. Select the configuration in JoyToKey
2. Test out your JoyCons to see if it maps properly

You will see the matching button highlighted in JoyToKey if it worked successfully.

### Copying Templates

Once JoyToKey is open, do the following

1. Right click on a template
2. Click copy
3. Give the new profile a name
4. Start mapping the buttons to various keys

## JoyCon L/R Template

This key mapping actually has no mappings. It only lists what button is which key in the comments section of each button.

This makes it easy for you to copy to a new configuration and edit keys without testing which button is which every time.

Note: This configuration is based on holding the left JoyCon in your left hand with the `-` button at the top of your hand, and the right JoyCon with the `+` button at the top of your hand.

Note 2: JoyCon L mappings will be under the Joystick 1 tab. JoyCon R mappings will be under the Joystick 2 tab.

## JoyCon L Template

This key mapping actually has no mappings. It only lists what button is which key in the comments section of each button.

This makes it easy for you to copy to a new configuration and edit keys without testing which button is which every time.

Note: This configuration is based on holding the left JoyCon in your left hand with the `-` button at the top of your hand.

## JoyCon R Template

This key mapping actually has no mappings. It only lists what button is which key in the comments section of each button.

This makes it easy for you to copy to a new configuration and edit keys without testing which button is which every time.

Note: This configuration is based on holding the right JoyCon in your right hand with the `+` button at the top of your hand.

## JoyCon R Slides

This key mapping is for slide presentations. Since you most often go forward instead of back, I mapped R, ZR, and A all to go forward. Only Y goes backward.
