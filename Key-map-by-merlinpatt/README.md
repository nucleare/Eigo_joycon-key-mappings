## Notes ##
The key mappings were forked from **https://github.com/merlinpatt/joycon-key-mappings** and have been included here.

To install these configurations, the default directory for the configuration files is in "**%USERPROFILE%\My Documents\JoyToKey**". 

If you do not see the configurations as loaded or appearing in the left side window as an available configuration pre-sets, make 
sure to completely quit the program (check taskbar) and re-open to refresh the list.

Learn more about the setup regarding configuration files from the original documentation from @merlinpatt
